# Cycling Speed and Cadence Ant+ to BLE Bridge

This is an Android app which reads ANT+ bike speed/cadence (CSC) sensor in the background, and advertises itself as a BLE device so that other devices can see this Android device as a Cycling Speed and Cadence Bluetooth BLE sensor. 

This is useful when you only have ANT+ CSC sensors but you want to connect to them as BLE sensors, provided that you don't have an USB ANT+ stick around but happen to have a ANT+ enabled Android device (like Samsung S8 that I have).


# Why

I want to try out Zwift desktop version but I can't get a USB ANT+ Stick anywhere now in my country. So I decided to write one.
